1. located android/app/build.gradle file 2. Then access below code in the gradle file

    buildTypes {
    release {

        // TODO: Add your own signing config for the release build.
        // Signing with the debug keys for now, so `flutter run --release` works.
        signingConfig signingConfigs.debug
    }
}
}

and changed it to

buildTypes {
    debug {
        minifyEnabled true

        // TODO: Add your own signing config for the release build.
        // Signing with the debug keys for now, so `flutter run --release` works.
        signingConfig signingConfigs.debug
    }
}
}

The app was able to run in Android emulator
